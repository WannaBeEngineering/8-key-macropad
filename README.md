Startup guide for the WannaBe 8-Key Macropad:

First off, thank you for purchasing this PCB, and I hope it works out great for you. I am no expert-coder, so the instructions and code I’ll be
providing are pretty basic.

Things you’ll need:
- The latest version of circuit python for the RP2040-zero (https://circuitpython.org/board/waveshare_rp2040_zero/)
    - Follow the link, then download the .UF2 file by clicking the big purple button
- The latest and greatest KMK firmware (https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware)
    - Click the green button labeled “Code”
    - Then select the bottom option “Download ZIP”
    - Navigate to your downloads folder, and unzip the file
- Lastly, the ‘code.py’ file, available in this repository. 
    - Click the green button labeled “Code”
    - Then select the bottom option “Download ZIP”
    - Navigate to your downloads folder, and unzip the file

Recommended:
- I recommend using the IDE Thonny. It’s super basic and easy to use while programming microcontrollers (https://thonny.org/). This would be useful
customizing your macropad layout, as well as debugging.  

Alright lets begin.
1. After you've assembled your PCB and are ready to start with the firmware, while holding down the 'BOOT' button on the RP2040-Zero,
   plug it into your computer via USB.
3. Open up your file explorer, on the left you should see a device mounted called something like “RPI-RP2”. Once you verify it’s
   properly mounted, take the .UF2 file you got from circuitpython.org, and drag it onto that drive. If done correctly, the drive
   will dismount, then remount under the new name “CIRCUITPY” after a few seconds.
4. Next, take the code.py file and drag it into the main directory of your CIRCUITPY drive.
5. Similar to step 3, we need to drag the KMK folder into the main directory. From within the kmk_firmware-master folder, look for
   the folder called “kmk”. Take that folder and drag it into the main directory of the CIRCUITPY drive, same as you did with the .UF2 file. 
6. At this point, you should be able to reset the macropad by using the reset button (opposite the boot button). Give it a few seconds, then
   pull up your notepad and give it a try. From left to right, top to bottom, the provided code will assign numbers 1-8. 

Great, hopefully, that worked smoothly. Now you’re ready to use the macropad as is, or you’re ready to customize the layout to your needs. You can find all the resources you need on the KMK Github, but I’ll specifically link to the key overview page (https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/en/keycodes.md).

Please provide me with any and all feedback if you feel the urge to. I’d like for these instructions to be clear and accurate, and make for a good experience. You can contact me through the Etsy shop, or by the email provided below.

Thanks again,
